It's gonna do stuff. And be simpler. And probably free if I can swing it.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Listen to Github webhook for pushes\r\n- [x] Create a temporary cloud server (currently using Ubuntu on Digital Ocean)\r\n- [x] Git clone into the server\r\n- [ ] Git checkout the exact commit\r\n- [x] Test suite runner (currently using [Mochawesome](http://adamgruber.github.io/mochawesome/) for test results)\r\n- [x] Upload test results\r\n- [ ] Use the Github API to post the test results back to the commit\r\n- [x] Take snapshot of cloud server to create versioned image\r\n\r\n# WHY???\r\n\r\nBecause I have so many of the pieces written already anyway for my main money-site, I might as well glue them together and polish it a bit so it can be re-used.\r\n",
